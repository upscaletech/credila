ML For Credit Analysis


The project is for developing a good Credit Scoring System that could help and accelerate the process of loan approval.  

Currently we are working on developing initial models with small data sets over MATLAB. 
If u want to contribute, i would suggest u go through the research papers published on Credit Scoring using ANN, so that u could get familiar with the financial domain and which methods are generally used for calculating credit rating of individual.
